        This prototype is a starting point for developing a robust dashboard based on
        the VERO methodology. Replace these stub pages and data modules with your
        own implementation to integrate real analytics, charts and KPIs.

        The goal is to provide a unified view across different asset classes and
        supply chains. The structure of this repo follows a modular approach,
        making it easy to expand or iterate on individual components.
